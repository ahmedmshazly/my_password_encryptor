# my_password_encryptor
Personal use app

Update the passwords in run.py and another in main.py and then run  pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole run.py in terminal, after that you will get a run.exe in ./dist that you will be able to use anywhere (but it has to have a folder ./data and an inside file called passwords.txt inside of it in the same directory)

-- run.exe
|
-- ./data
  |
  -- passwords.txt --> protect that one with a password as well
